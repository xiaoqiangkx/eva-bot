By decomposing tasks into smaller components, agents can better understand the steps involved and plan ahead effectively.\\n\\nOne common approach to task decomposition is the Chain of Thought (CoT) technique, which prompts models to \"think step by step\" and decompose hard tasks into simpler steps. Another extension of CoT is the Tree of Thoughts, which explores multiple reasoning possibilities at each step and generates a tree structure of thoughts.\\n\\nTask decomposition can be carried out using various methods, such as prompting language models with simple instructions, using task-specific instructions, or involving human inputs in the process. Ultimately, task decomposition helps in breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps for efficient planning and execution.', response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 168, 'prompt_tokens': 840, 'total_tokens': 1008}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-673fb756-25aa-46d7-bc6e-d8bb2ac89fc9-0')]}}\n",
